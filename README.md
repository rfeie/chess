# Welcome to Command Line Chess!

This is my implementation of chess on the command line. It is written in Ruby
and tested in Rspec. This was originally completed as the capstone project of
the Ruby section of The Odin Project. Now it is being updated to adhere to SOLID
principles and removing code smells and create cleaner code.

### How to play:

Simply type 'ruby play_chess.rb'
